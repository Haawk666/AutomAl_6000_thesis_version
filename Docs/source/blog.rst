Internal review version available (18.11.2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As promised, I've made an executable available for internal review. Those who were present on the Al-meeting on 15.
Nov 2019, will have received an e-mail. I've termed this version 'alpha 1.0'. The slides from the live demo are included
here in the mail.

Notes on this version:

* I had to disable the plotting and pca module, because matplotlibs's dll's were incurring DLL-hell at build-time. I will try to resolve this for future versions.
* This is not considered a 'public' version! Please see the disclaimers in the slides..
