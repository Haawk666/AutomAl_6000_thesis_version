Installation
---------------------------------------------

To install AutoAtom6000, simply follow the steps below.

    1. Go to the **download** section of this webpage, and download the zip-file provided under **Executable** to a
    desired location on your computer.

    2. Navigate to the downloaded zip-file on your computer, right click and select 'extract all' or something similar,
    depending on your operating system or installed compression software.

    3. (Optional) Navigate into the extracted folder and locate the 'aacc.exe' -file. Right click and select 'Send to
    -> desktop (create shortcut)', if a desktop shortcut is desired.

.. note::

    When starting AutoAtom, there will be a significant waiting-time (\~20 sec) before the GUI loads. This is because
    the exe will first build its environment in temporary folders, which takes some time. Unfortunately, as a
    consequence of pyinstaller's --onefile option, during this time there will be no indication that the program is
    running, so be patient before clicking several times! In the future, a full-fledged installer is planned, which will
    eliminate this 'quirk'.
